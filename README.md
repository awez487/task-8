# VPN Setup and Analysis Task
I selected **Proton VPN**, a trustworthy VPN provider offering unlimited data on the free plan.
Downloaded the official Proton VPN client from: (https://protonvpn.com)
### Connect to a VPN Server
Connected to the nearest free server in the available list.

Verify IP Address Has Changed
Used (https://whatismyipaddress.com) to check IP before and after VPN connection.
 **Before:** [ 192.168.0.101]
 **After:** [212.8.243.71]

Confirm Traffic is Encrypted
Browsed multiple HTTPS websites and noticed that traffic remained encrypted and accessible.

- Browsing speed slightly increased after disconnect.
- IP address reverted to actual location.
